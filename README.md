## Task1 
 ### 1.Select any file (large enough to have recordable download time) from the Internet and do the
following:
Download the file three times (for example at 7 am, 12 pm and 10 pm. You are free to change the
times) each day for a week.
Let the download times you record through the week at 7 am be D7i where i=1,â€¦,7 (one download
time at 7 am recorded per day). Similarly, the download times at 12 pm are D12i, and those at 10
pm are D10i.

### 2.Find three distributions that fit D7i, D12i, D10i, respectively.

### 3.Answer the following questions in the conclusion section of your report:

  a. Are the distributions similar?

  b. In view of the distributions properties, do you recommend a particular time for downloading the
file? If so, what is the expected gain in time saving based on your recommendation?

c. Try to repeat the experiment for a different file, located at a different server in different countries.
How does your recommendation change? Try to relate your recommendation to server location and
file size. 


## Task2
### Use bluetooth to transfer a file between two wireless devices. Choose a suitable file size so that the
transfer time is measurable (not too small). Find the distribution of file transfer time in each of the
following cases:
a. by repeating the measurement at different times.
b. by repeating the measurement for different distances between the wireless devices.
c. by repeating for different file sizes.
Comment on your results. Relate your comments to distance between devices and file sizes. If you
recommend a particular maximum distance between devices, explain in terms of the percentage
improvement in transfer time.


## Task3

### choose a set of random variables (for example the weight of an adult, his/her height, the weight of
the transfer time in previous task). Take a sample of each variable and compute its mean from the
sample you collected (for example 5 readings). Gradually, increase the sample size (for example to
10 readings, 12 then 15 and so on) until the mean you compute is independent from the sample size.
Based on that recommend a suitable sample size for each variable for accurate estimation of the
mean
